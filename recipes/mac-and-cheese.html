    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Macaroni and cheese (also known as mac and cheese in Canada and the United States and macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom) is a dish of macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly cheddar sauce.</em></strong></p>

    <p>Its origins trace back to cheese and pasta casseroles dating to the 14th century in Italy and medieval England. The traditional macaroni and cheese is put in a casserole and baked in the oven; however, it may be prepared in a sauce pan on top of the stove or using a packaged mix. The cheese is often first incorporated into a BÃ©chamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce, which is then added to the pasta. In the United States and Canada, it is considered a comfort food by many.</p>
