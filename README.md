## General Info
[This project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) is from the [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).

`odin-recipes` is a basic recipe website which consists of a main index page with links to a few recipes. Each recipe has an image of the finished dish, a small description, the set of ingredients and the steps needed to recreate the dish.
