## General Info
[This project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) is from the [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).

`odin-recipes` is a basic recipe website which consists of a main index page with links to a few recipes. Each recipe has an image of the finished dish, a small description, the set of ingredients and the steps needed to recreate the dish.

## Self Reflections
This whole process was very stimulating. I learned a lot of stuff like setting up the project, using the command line interface, the basics of git, foundational knowledge of HTML, the proper way to use commit messages, writing a README, and publishing/viewing the project on the web.

An update: I updated my knowledge and added a bit of CSS. This included the use of different kinds of selectors, ways to group and chain selectors, and combinators. This also had various different CSS properties related to color, background-color, typography properties, etc. Lastly, I kept in mind the CSS cascade, inheritance and rule order.

Another update: I did some tinkering and extended the project again. After learning how to inspect HTML and CSS, and how to utilize the standard and alternative box model, I applied additional CSS to make it relatively "prettier" (than before).
